# Honey-production-analysis-project
This project is based on exploratory data analysis.
The dataset being taken is Honey Production which is freely available on Kaggle.
The dataset has many unique attributes and values.
I have made use of python libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib majorly.
I have done data cleaning and preprocessing steps in this project.
Next, I have plotted several types of graphs and written my observations for the same below the plotted graphs.
The final conclusion has reasons for the decreasing rate of Honey Production.
At last,I stated conclusions and suggestions for increasing the honey production
demand based on my analysis of the dataset.

This is a project done individually by me to learn and get acknowleged with python and its libraries.
